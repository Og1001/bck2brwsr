# Bring Java Back to Browser!

[Bck2Brwsr](http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org) VM is a Java virtual machine which is capable to take bytecode and convert it
(either ahead-of-time e - e.g. during compilation on desktop - or just-in-time, e.g. in a browser) 
into appropriate JavaScript code which does the same thing. As a result one can write in Java, 
compile with JavaC, process it with [Bck2Brwsr](http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org) 
(usually via its Maven plugin, but possibly also directly via programmatic APIs) into 
JavaScript file(s) that can be executed in any modern browser.
